	<h1>Time,Space,and Complexity</h1>
	<p>Certainly! Here's a concise summary of time complexity:

**Time complexity** measures how efficient an algorithm performs based on input size. We often express it using Big O notation (e.g., O(n), O(n^2), O(log n)).</p>
<p><b>Space Complexity </b>refers to the amount of memory an algorithm O(n) needs to execute. When dealing with large datasets or limited memory resources, understanding space complexity becomes crucial. It’s like making sure your algorithm doesn’t hog all the memory at the party!</p>
